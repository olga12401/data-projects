# What is it Vnet

VNet (Virtual Network) is a fundamental building block used to logically isolate and securely connect Azure resources. It allows гs to create your own private space in the cloud, similar to an on-premises network, where we can launch Azure services, like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more.

№№ Key components of a VNet include:

**Subnets:** Segments within the VNet that help organize and manage resources. Subnets can be used to allocate resources logically and apply different network security configurations.

**Network Security Groups (NSGs):** These act as firewalls for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources. NSGs allow or deny traffic based on rules that you define.

**Virtual Network Gateways:** These enable secure connectivity between Azure VNets and other networks, such as on-premises networks or other Azure VNets. They can also be used for establishing site-to-site or point-to-site VPN connections.

VNets provide features like network isolation, segmentation, and control over IP addressing, DNS settings, security policies, and routing. They play a crucial role in designing and implementing Azure infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability while ensuring secure communication between resources.
