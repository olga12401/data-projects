# Subscription

## Info

An Azure subscription is essentially a logical container that holds the resources you use in Azure. When you create an Azure account, you get access to a free Azure subscription, which provides you with a set of services and resources that you can use to build, deploy, and manage applications and services in the cloud.

Here are some key points about Azure subscriptions:

**Access to Azure Services:**
Subscriptions grant access to various Azure services such as virtual machines, databases, storage, networking resources, AI services, and more.

**Billing and Payment:** 
Subscriptions are tied to billing. You are billed based on the resources you consume within your subscription. Azure offers different pricing models, including pay-as-you-go, monthly commitments, and enterprise agreements.

**Resource Limits and Quotas:** 
Each subscription has default limits and quotas on the number of resources you can create. These can be increased by contacting Azure support.

**Access Control and Management:** 
Azure subscriptions have role-based access control (RBAC) that allows you to assign specific permissions to users, groups, or applications, controlling their access to resources within the subscription.

**Resource Organization:** 
You can organize resources using resource groups within a subscription. Resource groups help manage and organize related resources for an application or project.

**Regional Scope:** 
A subscription is associated with a specific Azure region or geographical area. Resources deployed within a subscription are generally confined to that region, although some services offer global reach.

**Azure Policies and Governance:** 
Subscriptions can be managed using Azure policies, which allow you to enforce rules and regulations across your resources to ensure compliance and security.

Subscriptions are the foundational element of Azure, providing the framework for using and managing Azure services. You can have multiple subscriptions associated with a single Azure account, and each subscription operates independently in terms of billing and resource management.

It's important to choose the right subscription type and manage it effectively based on your organization's needs to optimize costs, security, and resource management within Azure.
